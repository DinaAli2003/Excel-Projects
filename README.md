## Project Overview üìã

Each project within this repository follows a structured approach to data analysis, ensuring accuracy, thoroughness, and effective communication of results. The key phases demonstrated in each project include:

### 1. Data Cleaning üßπ
* **Handling Missing Values:** Techniques used to identify and manage null or empty data points.
* **Data Consistency:** Ensuring uniform formatting, spelling, and unit of measure across the dataset.
* **Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Identifying and addressing unusual data points that could skew analysis.
* **Data Transformation:** Converting data types or restructuring data for better analysis readiness.

### 2. Data Modeling and Preparation üèóÔ∏è
* **Relational Design:** Structuring data tables and defining relationships using features like VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and Power Query (where applicable).
* **Creating Calculated Fields:** Developing new metrics and variables using Excel formulas (e.g., SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, AVERAGEIFS, Logical functions).
* **Data Aggregation:** Summarizing data at different levels for trend analysis and reporting.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating key statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) to understand data distribution.
* **Data Visualization:** Utilizing charts (bar, line, pie, scatter plots, etc.) and pivot tables to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
* **Hypothesis Testing (Conceptual):** Analyzing data to inform and validate initial assumptions in some projects.

### 4. Extracting Insights and Reporting üí°
* **Key Findings:** Identifying and documenting the most significant insights derived from the data.
* **Storytelling with Data:** Presenting findings in a clear, narrative-driven manner that addresses the project's objectives.
* **Actionable Recommendations:** Translating insights into practical suggestions for business or operational improvement.

### 5. Building Interactive Dashboards üñ•Ô∏è
* **Dynamic Visualization:** Designing visually appealing and informative dashboards using charts and pivot tables.
* **User Interactivity:** Implementing features like **Slicers** and **Timelines** to allow users to filter and analyze data dynamically.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Highlighting essential metrics for easy tracking and monitoring.

## How to Navigate the Repository üó∫Ô∏è

Each project is contained within its own dedicated folder. To explore a project:

1.  **Browse the folders:** Each folder name will indicate the project's focus (e.g., *Store_Analysis_Dashboard*, *Sustainability_Dashboard*).
2.  **Download the Excel file:** The primary project file will be an `.xlsx` .
3.  **Review the files:** Examine the worksheet to follow the data journey:
    * **Raw Data**  worksheet for the initial dataset.
    * **Data Cleaned/Modeled** worksheet(s) for the processed data.
    * **Analysis/EDA**  worksheet(s) for interim calculations and visualizations.
    * **Dashboard**  worksheet(s) for the final interactive product.

## Technical Requirements and Dependencies ‚öôÔ∏è

These projects are built using native Microsoft Excel functionalities. They should be viewable and fully functional on:

* **Microsoft Excel (2016 or newer is recommended)**
* **Microsoft 365 (Office 365)**

*Note: Features like Power Query/Power Pivot, if used, may require an appropriate version of Excel for full functionality.*
